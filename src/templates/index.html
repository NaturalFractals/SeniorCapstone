<h3 align="center">When and What to tweet about</h3>
<p align="center">An analysis by Patrick Beekman</p>

<!-- Page content -->
<div class="w3-content w3-padding-large w3-margin-top" id="portfolio">

    <h3><u>Intro</u></h3>
    <p>
        Twitter can be a wild and confusing place with a plethora of information readily available.
        The problem is that twitter is constantly being flooded with noise, often times making it difficult for your
        tweets to stand out and gain attention. That is the inspiration for this analysis, I have studied
        the best times to tweet, best emotions and keywords that should be used to give your tweets the most
        traction. Something to note is that all this analysis has been done with my ~200 followers and 2,000
        tweets for each of those users. Not all followers have 2,000 tweets so after all data collection and
        cleaning I collected about 250,000 tweets. This analysis is specific to my followers and how I can
        gear my tweets towards my followers to get the largest exposure. With this project anyone can download
        the <a href="https://github.com/patrickbeekman/SeniorCapstone" target="_blank">project from github</a> and do this analysis on their own followers. My analysis can still be generalized
        to see a general trend in tweets that anyone can follow to give their tweets exposure.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Analysis</u></h3>

    <h4><u>Comparing days of the week</u></h4>
    <!-- Plots -->
    <p>
        When to tweet is an important part of getting people to see your tweets. I created a bargraph
        of the amount of tweets during <a href="#daysOfWeek">each day of the week (shown below)</a> to see if there was an ideal
        day to tweet when there is more activity happening. Looking at the graph we can see that throughout
        the week it seems to be about the same amount of activity but it drops off during the weekend. There
        are about 4000-5000 less tweets on the weekends compared to weekdays this is about a 16% decrease
        in twitter activity on the weekends. So if you are looking to get more eyes on your tweets you may
        want to consider tweeting on a weekday.
    </p>
    <img src="img/days_of_week.png" alt="daysOfWeek" width="603" height="346" class="w3-image" align="center" id="daysOfWeek">
    <p>
        Just knowing what day of the week to possibly tweet on is not enough to get your tweet seen.
        A more important indicator of tweet exposure is the amount of favorites and retweets you get
        on your tweets. The more retweets the further exposure you have with your tweets, the more favorites
        the more people enjoy your tweets and are likely to retweet or share with friends. The <a href="#unNormFavRTs">plot below</a>
        looks at the number of favorites and retweets grouped by hour for any particular day. We can see
        there is a spike in the amount of favorites at hours 16(4pm) and 19(7pm). As for retweets the spike
        is at hours 12(12pm) and 21(9pm). An interesting note is that the amount of retweets and favorites
        appears to be correlated where the retweets follows the amount of favorites.
    </p>
    <div align="center" id="unNormFavRTs">
        {{ unNormalized_FavsRTs_script|safe }}
        {{ unNormalized_FavsRTs_div|safe }}
    </div>
    <p>
        For a better informative view we can break it down by day of week to see when
        favorites and retweets are happening over time for each day(<a href="#favsRTs_DoW">as seen below</a>).
        Looking through the days we can see that each appears to have a distinct hour where there is a peak in
        favorites/retweets. For example Sunday:19(7pm), Monday:9(9am) Tuesday:20(8pm), 21(9pm) Wednesday:19(7pm), 22(10pm)...etc.
        There seems to be a general trend over the days that points to a peak in activity around hours 16 to 19, but the more
        interesting information is the peaks at the other times of day. Take a look at the graph for Friday, the largest
        peak for the day is at noon which is different than other days. It should be kept in mind when tweeting on fridays
        that you will have to tweet earlier in the day to have the greatest potential of favorites and retweets.

    </div>
    <h4 id="NormTitle"><u>Normalizing the data</u></h4>
    <p>
        You may have noticed while looking at the above two plots that there are some large spikes in the data.
        This kind of plot is not very informative because these are just raw values, maybe one user with a lot of
        followers tweets frequently at a specific hour. This is how the data gets skewed, fortunately there is a
        way to fix this!
    </p>
    <p>
        To solve this we want every users tweets to have an equal importance to each other. To do this we will normalize
        the data by the amount of followers the user has. A user that has 40,000 followers and gets 20,000 favorites on a
        tweet will be accounted for the same as a user who has 400 followers and gets 200 favorites. This smoothes out
        the plots created by bringing all the users into the same scale thus removing the high peaks in the graphs. This
        can be seen by comparing the graphs of all tweets favorites and retweets when it is <a href="#normFavRTs">normalized (below)</a>
        and <a href="#unNormFavRTs">not normalized (above)</a>.
    </p>
    <div align="center" id="normFavRTs">
        {{ normalized_FavsRTs_script|safe }}
        {{ normalized_FavsRTs_div|safe }}
    </div>
    <p>
        Now that we have normalized the data to reduce the peaks we can get a better idea of how the favorites and retweets are distributed over time. The new normalized value represents the average amount of favorites or retweets for that hour. Using these new plots we have a more accurate representation of when users are online
        and interacting(favoriting and retweeting) with tweets. Lets take a look at Sunday, in the non-normalized version
        there are two large peaks of favorites at hours 19(7pm) and 21(9pm) which drones out the rest of the data. With such large outlier
        data points its hard to see the daily trend. With the normalized view of Sunday we can see there is a wider peak
        of favorites that ranges from hour 15(3pm) to 19(7pm). This wide peak stretching over a couple of hours is more
        representative of how users act on twitter rather than two distinct peaking hours as seen in the non-normalized data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using these graphs we can quickly see at what times you should tweet to have increase the tweet potential of
        getting more favorites and retweets. Looking at the Tuesday normalized plot (below) there is a big peak in retweets,
        the largest in any of the graphs and may be an ideal time to tweet if you are looking to get retweets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Something interesting to note is that while Sunday <a href="#daysOfWeek">has the least amount of overall tweets</a> it has
        the highest consistent peaks of favorites out of any day. It also has the highest consistent peak of retweets. <b>It
        appears that Sunday from hour 13-19(3pm-7pm) is an ideal time of day to tweet at</b>.

    <h4><u>Analyzing the emotion of tweets over time</u></h4>
    <p>
        Now that we have a general idea of the times and days of the week to tweet at you should probably figure out the
        content of your tweet that will reach the largest audience and maximize the amount of favorites and retweets you
        receive. One way to look at what you should be tweeting is to think in terms of the emotions illicited by your tweet.
        I used IBM Watson's tone analyzer to find the tone of each users tweet. I then took this data and graphed the favorites
        and retweets received by that tweet split by the emotion (<a href="#normFavRTs">seen below</a>), I also normalized
        for <a href="#NormTitle">similar reasons stated above</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Something interesting to note in the graphs is the increase in favorites for the sad and angry tweets around
        midnight. None of the other emotions have a local peak late at night except for these two emotions, except for
        fear which often times goes hand in hand with sadness and anger. This should be in line with what you would expect,
        it makes sense that people are tweeting sadder during the night because that's when people are reflecting on past
        events and experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another notable mention is the heights of the peaks for each graph. Keep in mind that this data is all normalized
        by the amount of followers each user had which means the heights of graph represent the average normalized amount
        of favorites at each hour. But we can see that analytical and joyus tweets have peaks at 12 and 16 respectively
        which is much higher than the other kinds of emotions. This is likely in part because people tweet a lot of happy
        and analytical tweets but also that there is high response rate to those tweets as seen by the heightened amount of
        favorites and retweets. <b>Tweeting something Analytical or Joyus may be in your best interest to maximize the
        potential of getting favorites or retweets.</b>
    </p>
    <div align="center" id="normFavRTsEmotions">
        {{ norm_FavsRTs_emotion_script|safe }}
        {{ norm_FavsRTs_emotion_div|safe }}
    </div>
    <p>
        Another type of graph that will help to determine the best time to tweet is to look at how many tweets are also
        being sent at that hour? The graph below shows the total amount of tweets I collected for each hour from all my followers.
    </p>
    <div align="center">
        {{ tweets_hourly_script|safe }}
        {{ tweets_hourly_div|safe }}
    </div>
    <p>
        The amount of tweets per hour plays a large roll in whether your tweet gets seen or not. The more likely your tweet is
        to get seen the more likely you are to get favorites and retweets. Comparing the amount of tweets every hour with
        the amount of favorites and retweets every hour we can determine an ideal time to tweet. The sweet spot is where
        there are few tweets but a lot of favorites and retweets. Breaking it down by emotion we get the plots below.
    </p>
    <div align="center" id="sideBySide">
        {{ side_by_side_script|safe }}
        {{ side_by_side_div|safe }}
    </div>
    <p>
        Examining both graphs side by side we gain some new insight into the ideal time to tweet. Looking at the Sadness
        graphs we see a peak in the amount of favorites/retweets at midnight but there are also a lot of tweets at that hour
        so your tweets will be drowned out then. You would be better off waiting until 6,7, or even 8 in the morning to tweet
        because there is a surplus in the amount of favorites/retweets compared to the amount of tweets being sent at those hours.
        The same thinking can be applied to all the graphs above. Another example can be seen in the Fear graphs where
        the peaks in favorites/retweets do not line up with the peaks in the amount of tweets per hour plot.
    </p>
    <h4><u>Analyzing word counts by emotion</u></h4>
    <p>
        Time and emotion are two important factors to look at when trying to maximize the potential from your tweet, but once
        you figure out those two things what exactly do you tweet about? Are there certain keywords that you can use in your tweets
        to gain the largest attention. The plots below help to give you an idea of what keywords to use broken down by emotion.
        The plots were created by taking the top hundred tweets from each user (sorted by Favorites then retweets) and then
        creating a word count. After I then removed all of the common words such as 'I', 'He', 'This', etc. and removed some
        specific words that weren't informative such as '&amp', '`', and '-'.

        {{ emotions_word_ct_div|safe }}
    </div>
    <h4><u>Interesting Aside</u></h4>
    <p>
        This graph below shows a simple time series of the amount of tweets for each day since the beginnings of twitter in 2009ish.
        While it doesn't necessarily help to maximize the potential of your tweet is interesting to look at the outliers in the graph.
        For example the peak on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2014_July_8">July 7th, 2014</a> is likely one of two things, either Germany beating Brazil 7-1 in the world cup
        to mark history or the earthquake off the coast of Japan that caused a Tsunami and mass evacuation. The next big
        spike all around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2014_July_8">June 7th, 2016</a> aligns with the US election primaries.
        And on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2016_November_9">November 9th, 2016</a> Donald Trump won the election which can clearly be seen on the graph, whats interesting about
        this spike is that its just for the day when I felt the shock of him winning lasted more than a day. This was just
        an interesting aside that I found when exploring the data and creating some preliminary plots.

    <h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
    <p>
        Hopefully with this analysis you now have a good idea of general trends on twitter and some ideas as to how you can
        increase the potential of your tweets! To generalize from the analysis the ideal day of the week to tweet is Sunday
        because of the high amount of favorites/retweets and the lower than average amount of tweets for that day. Looking at
        the hours for that day it would be ideal to tweet between hours 13 and 19, 3pm and 7pm respectively. As for the
        emotion of your tweet you should consider Joyus and Analytical tweets for their high amounts of favorites/retweets!
        From here you can now look at the <a href="#sideBySide">favorites/retweets side by side with tweet counts graphs</a>
        and the <a href="#wordCount">word count graphs</a> to narrow down the content of your tweet more specifically.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this general analysis wasn't enough you can populate all the graphs with
        your own followers. If you follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/patrickbeekman/SeniorCapstone">github repo page</a> you can analyze your followers and
        find the ideal times to tweet so that they will favorite and retweet your tweets!

        Better peak detection and removing "fake retweets" that show as a users tweet.
        Look at amount of comments on a tweet as well as the favorites and retweets.
    </p>
