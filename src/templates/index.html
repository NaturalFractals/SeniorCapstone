    <h4><u>Intro</u></h4>
    <p>
        Twitter can be a wild and confusing place with a plethora of information readily available.
        Unfortunately twitter is constantly being flooded with noise, often times it is difficult for your
        tweets to stand out and gain traction. That is the inspiration for this analysis, I have studied
        the best times to tweet, best emotions and keywords that should be used to give your tweets the most
        traction. Something to note is that all this analysis has been done with my ~200 followers and 2,000
        tweets for each of those users. Not all followers have 2,000 tweets so after all data collection and
        cleaning I collected about 250,000 tweets. This analysis is specific to my followers and how I can
        gear my tweets towards my followers to get the largest exposure. With this project anyone can download
        the <a href="https://github.com/patrickbeekman/SeniorCapstone" target="_blank">project from github</a> and do this analysis on their own followers. My analysis can still be generalized
        to see a general trend in tweets that anyone can follow to give their tweets exposure.
    </p>

    <h4><u>Analysis</u></h4>
    <!-- Plots -->
    <p>
        When to tweet is an important part of getting people to see your tweets. I created a bargraph
        of the amount of tweets during <a href="#daysOfWeek">each day of the week (shown below)</a> to see if there was an ideal
        day to tweet when there is more activity happening. Looking at the graph we can see that throughout
        the week it seems to be about the same amount of activity but it drops off during the weekend. There
        are about 4000-5000 less tweets on the weekends compared to weekdays this is about a 16% decrease
        in twitter activity on the weekends. So if you are looking to get more eyes on your tweets you may
        want to consider tweeting on a weekday.

        Just knowing what day of the week to possibly tweet on is not enough to get your tweet seen.
        A more important indicator of tweet exposure is the amount of favorites and retweets you get
        on your tweets. The more retweets the further exposure you have with your tweets, the more favorites
        the more people enjoy your tweets and are likely to retweet or share with friends. The <a href="#unNormFavRTs">plot below</a>
        looks at the number of favorites and retweets grouped by hour for any particular day. We can see
        there is a spike in the amount of favorites at hours 16(4pm) and 19(7pm). As for retweets the spike
        is at hours 12(12pm) and 21(9pm). An interesting note is that the amount of retweets and favorites
        appears to be correlated where the retweets follows the amount of favorites.

    </div>
    <p>
        For a better informative view we can break it down by day of week to see when
        favorites and retweets are happening over time for each day(<a href="#favsRTs_DoW">as seen below</a>).
        Looking through the days we can see that each appears to have a distinct hour where there is a peak in
        favorites/retweets. For example Sunday:19(7pm), Monday:9(9am) Tuesday:20(8pm), 21(9pm) Wednesday:19(7pm),22(10pm)...etc.
        There seems to be a general trend over the days that points to a peak in activity around hours 16 to 19, but the more
        interesting information is the peaks at the other times of day. Take a look at the graph for Friday, the largest
        peak for the day is at noon which is different than other days. It should be kept in mind when tweeting on fridays
        that you will have to tweet earlier in the day to have the greatest potential of favorites and retweets.

    <p>
        You may have noticed while looking at the above two plots that there are some large spikes in the data.
        This kind of plot is not very informative because these are just raw values, maybe one user with a lot of
        followers tweets frequently at a specific hour. This is how the data gets skewed, fortunately there is a
        way to fix this!
    </p>
    <p>
        To solve this we want every users tweets to have an equal importance to each other. To do this we will normalize
        the data by the amount of followers the user has. A user that has 40,000 followers and gets 20,000 favorites on a
        tweet will be accounted for the same as a user who has 400 followers and gets 200 favorites. This smoothes out
        the plots created by bringing all the users into the same scale thus removing the high peaks in the graphs. This
        can be seen by comparing the graphs of all tweets favorites and retweets when it is <a href="#normFavRTs">normalized (below)</a>
        and <a href="#unNormFavRTs">not normalized (above)</a>.
    </p>
    <div align="center" id="normFavRTs">
        {{ normalized_FavsRTs_script|safe }}
        {{ normalized_FavsRTs_div|safe }}
    </div>
    <p>
        Now that we have normalized the data to reduce the peaks we can get a better idea of how the favorites and retweets
        are distributed over time. Using these new plots we have a more accurate representation of when users are online
        and interacting(favoriting and retweeting) with tweets. Lets take a look at Sunday, in the non-normalized version
        there are two large peaks of favorites at hours 19(7pm) and 21(9pm) which drones out the rest of the data. With such large outlier
        data points its hard to see the daily trend. With the normalized view of Sunday we can see there is a wider peak
        of favorites that ranges from hour 15(3pm) to 19(7pm). This wide peak stretching over a couple of hours is more
        representative of how users act on twitter rather than two distinct peaking hours as seen in the non-normalized data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using these graphs we can quickly see at what times you should tweet to have increase the tweet potential of
        getting more favorites and retweets. Looking at the Tuesday normalized plot (below) there is a big peak in retweets,
        the largest in any of the graphs and may be an ideal time to tweet if you are looking to get retweets.
