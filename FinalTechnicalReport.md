## Introduction

### Problem, Objective and Users
Twitter can be a wild and confusing place with a plethora of information readily available. The problem is that twitter is constantly being flooded with noise, often times making it difficult for your tweets to stand out and gain attention. That was the inspiration for this project, I have studied the best times to tweet, emotions and keywords that should be used to maximize the potential of your tweets and give it the most attention. The goal of this project was to create a simple way for users to analyze the trends of their followers and easily interpret the graphs to determine how to maximize the potential of their next tweet. The application needed to be easy to use because the users of this are not expected to know programming, only to have some basic knowledge of using computers. This application is meant for small business social media marketers so they can get a better idea about the trends of their followers and gear their tweets toward them. Increasingly businesses are using twitter to communicate with their customers/users, but with each new follower it becomes harder to appeal to your followers hence the need for my application. Other users of my application include general twitter users who have something important to say and want to ensure it makes the largest impact on their followers. One example my application could be used is if a user had thoughts or a story to contribute to the #metoo campaign, they may want to make sure as many people hear what they have to say as possible. 

### Relevant Background Information
Unsurprisingly enough twitter does something similar to my application except they have approached the problem from the other side. Instead of your twitter timeline (tweets from all your followers) being displayed chronologically they actually tailor it so tweets they think you will like appear closer to the top of your timeline[1](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline). Twitter does this in an attempt to increase the amount of engagements each tweet receives, they define an engagement as the ”total number of times a user interacted with a Tweet. Clicks anywhere on the Tweet, including Retweets, replies, follows, likes, links, cards, hashtags, embedded media, username, profile photo, or Tweet expansion”[2](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/using-the-tweet-activity-dashboard). If users are getting more impressions on their tweets they are then likely to use twitter more which is what twitter wants so they can increase their ad revenue. My project approaches from the other side and strives to maximize the potential impressions for a single tweet which in turn can help the user gain more attention on twitter and grow their business or spread a message to their followers. While my application is different from twitter's algorithm it is impossible for them to not overlap. For example the time that a tweet is sent may not be an accurate measure in my analysis because twitter will choose where to place the tweet in a users timeline affecting the time that it is seen by the users followers.

### Problem Scope and features
This project gives the user an overview of the general trends found in their followers. It specifically looks at the trends of when favorites and retweets happen throughout a day and how that relates to the tone of the tweet, the day of the week and the amounts of tweets per hour. It will also show you some keywords found in popular tweets of your followers split by emotion. The user can analyze these graphs on the website themselves to determine an ideal time and content for their tweet. It gives the user an easy way to aggregate all of their followers and view interactive visualizations of these general trends. My application does not give the user a single perfect time and content to tweet about. My application does not take into account replies to tweets, link clicks or other tweet engagement [2](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/using-the-tweet-activity-dashboard) information that twitter takes into account for their timeline placement algorithm. It does not guarantee more engagement from your followers but simply tries to increase the likelihood that they will favorite or retweet your tweet.
