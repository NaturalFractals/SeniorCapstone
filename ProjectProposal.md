# Exploring emotional trends on Twitter
#### By: Patrick Beekman

## Project Overview
With this project I plan to expand my knowledge on exploratory data science and web development. Since I took a machine learning course over the summer I have been very interested in what data has to offer and I can explore the meaning behind the data. This interest has pushed me to start a side project of analyzing my friends tweets to find fun and insightful meaning, statistics and correlations. With this capstone I am going to move in a different direction and learn how to pursue more complex analyses and how to best visualize my findings. To display these visualizations an interactive website seems to make the most sense so anyone can view, examine and explore my findings on any computer with internet access. This Capstone is a research project 

website design knowledge is lacking so it will not be too crazy but at least the foundation will be there for me to expand on the knowledge I learn from this capstone project.

## Similar Works
Researchers at stanford did something [similar](https://web.stanford.edu/~jesszhao/files/twitterSentiment.pdf) by analyzing the sentiment of users tweets about presidental candidates. In this study they focused on creating a machine learning model to analyze tweets and predict an emotion, while I will be using IBM Watsons tone analyzer to do this. The difference between these is that the model used in the study only predicts a single emotion while Watson returns the specific likelihoods for each of the five emotions which can give more insight into my data. One interesting idea the study took into account was the use of looking at emojis after they found a large percentage of tweets included them. I want to include this concept into my analysis as well, I will create my own mapping of common emojis into emotional buckets. Another piece of interest from this paper is what tweets they collected to represent the whole of a populations opinion about the candidates. They just simply looked for a small sample of keywords and the candidates name. I do not think this is enough and I am going to look at the replies to a candidate's(or any generic user) tweets to find the emotional response to that tweet but with enough of these pooled together I hope to gain an overview of the publics opion about a candidate(specific user).
